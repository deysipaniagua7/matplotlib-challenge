# matplotlib-challenge

This is the repository that holds my matplotlib-challenge assignment.

Module Overview: For this study, we were asked to compare the performance of Capomulin against all other drug treatments. We had to 1) prepare the data, 2) generate summary statistics, and: 

3) Create bar charts for the total number of mice per drug regimen,
4) Create pie charts for the sex distribution among mice,
5) Calculate quartiles and find outliers,
6) Create a box plot for the tumor volume distribution per drug regimen,
7) Create a line plot for the Capomulin Treatment of unique mouse (x401),
8) Create a scatter plot for the Mouse Weight vs Tumor Volume Average,
9) and calculate correlation and regression.
